# Om Chatbot - Sentimental Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiments of mental health statuses using machine learning techniques. By exploring a dataset of mental health-related text and performing preprocessing, visualization, and model training, we aim to accurately classify sentiments. This work lays the foundation for future applications, such as real-world mental health monitoring and chatbot development.

## Features
- Sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression model
- Preprocessing of text data for enhanced accuracy
- Data visualization to understand patterns and trends
- Model training and evaluation
